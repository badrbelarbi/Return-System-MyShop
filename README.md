# project introduction
Here is a quick description of MyShop taken from their website:
“With myShop.com’s SaaS software you can start an online store - in both the consumer market
(B2C) and business market (B2B).
At myShop.com you can design an online store to your own taste. Dozens of templates, colours and
layouts are available for this. You can set up your online store in various languages. It is also possible
to manage multiple web shops within one account.”
Project Client on Board is one of the courses we must do during our second year of Software
Engineering, in this course we will be collaborating with the company of MyShop to design a
prototype system to make product returns, called RMA. With this system, customers will be able to
return items, through a web page application, that allows them to know the conditions that the
products must be in and the products they are allowed to return. Then the package will be received
by the collector, who will do an inspection and a report, then send to the controller who will decide if
the product gets returned or not. Thanks to this prototype the developers and system managers of
MyShop will be able to inspire themselves, to improve their current return operations.
We aim to deliver a product that not only meets the technical requirements but also provides a
valuable learning experience for our team and their individual set of learning objectives they wish
they achieve in this course.
