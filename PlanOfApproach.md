<a name="_page40_x69.00_y502.92"></a> Plan of approach:

**Development Plan and Milestones Sprint 1**: Basic Functionality and Setup

Goal: Establish the foundational environment and basic front-end functionality for one user type (collector/controller) and customer.

Key Tasks:

Set up the development environment.

Develop API calls for the backend database.

Begin frontend development for collector/controller and customer modules.

Establish basic testing protocols.

Milestone: Functional prototype with basic user interactions and data fetching from the database. **Sprint 2**: Advanced Development and Feature Integration

Goal: Expand upon the initial functionalities to build a more complete version of the RMA application.

Key Tasks:

Develop and integrate additional requirements and features for various user roles.

Enhance frontend and backend connectivity.

Implement more comprehensive testing and debugging.

Milestone: Advanced version of the RMA application with integrated features for all user roles. **Sprint 3**: Refinement and Finalization

Goal: Perfect the application by fixing issues, implementing extra features, and finalizing the project. Key Tasks:

Address any remaining bugs or issues.

Add final touches and additional requested features.

Conduct thorough testing and quality assurance.

Prepare for project presentation and delivery.

Milestone: Completed, polished, and fully functional RMA application ready for deployment.

**Results (Deliverables)**

RMA Application: A web-based responsive application easing product returns.

Documentation: Detailed design documents, user stories, wireframes, functional and non-functional requirements.

Testing Environment: A mock-up test environment for order management. **Organization**

Team Structure: Collaborative approach with clearly defined roles and responsibilities. Meetings:

Class stand-ups every Tuesday and Thursday for progress sharing and problem-solving. Weekend collaboration sessions via Discord for review and planning.

Communication:

Regular updates through WhatsApp or Discord.

Use of GitLab for tracking progress on user stories.

Shared documentation for task and project documentation, scrum process and time management. **Borders and Risks**

Scope:

In-Scope: Development of the RMA application, testing environment, and related documentation. Out-of-Scope: External system integrations not related to RMA processing.

Group Agreements: Adherence to our code of conduct, regular communication, and collaborative problem-solving.

Risk Management:

Regular review of progress and goals.

Adaptive task management in case of delays or complexities. (breakdown of big into smaller workable pieces).
