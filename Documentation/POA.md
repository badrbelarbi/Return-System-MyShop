# Project Plan: RMA Application Development

## Introduction

This section provides an overview of the RMA (Return Merchandise Authorization) application project, outlining its objectives and intended benefits.

## Project Overview

### Project Name
- Client On Board, Team 2

### Objective
- To design and develop a prototype RMA system for MyShop, enabling customers to return items easily and efficiently through a web-based application.   

### Scope
- In-Scope: Development of the RMA application, the testing environment and related documentation along with any external systems needed for the application to work, for example, 
a mailing system or barcode scanner in this case.

## Data Handling and Version Control

- For Data Handling and Version Control, we will use GitLab, this will allow us to create branches that each team member will work on, and after working, the team member can merge 
to the main after testing. This allows us to make sure there we can safely experiment and test our code before pushing directly into the main, ensuring that the new code remains safely contained.

## Team Structure and Communication

### Team Roles and Responsibilities
- For this project, we will have 4 Scrum Masters, one for each new sprint. Sprint 0 is Pablo, 1 is Frankie, 2 is Georgi, and 3 is Badr. 
- Each will also have a note taker, for Sprint 0 is Brice, Sprint 1 is Badr, Sprint 2 is Desmond, Sprint 3 is Frankie.
- We also have a Project Manager who will make sure we stay on track as a whole, this will be Desmond.

### Communication Channels
- Primary channels: We will use WhatsApp and Discord for regular updates on our code and for letting each other know when we merge to main.
- GitLab for progress tracking on the Backlog.

### Meeting Schedule
- We have class stand-ups every Tuesday and Thursday. We will then have at least one meeting every weekend, the day will depend on the availability of the team members.

## Development Plan and Milestones

### Sprint 1: Basic Functionality and Setup
- Goal: Establish a test environment and basic User Interface for the RMA application.
- Key Tasks: Set up the databases and development environment, develop API calls, begin frontend svelte development.
- Milestone: Completed Databases with queries and a basic User Interface.

### Sprint 2: Advanced Development and Feature Integration
- Goal: Connect the databases to the frontend and complete the data fetches.
- Key Tasks: Develop additional features, enhance frontend and backend connectivity.
- Milestone: Advanced version of the RMA application with integrated features.

### Sprint 3: Refinement and Finalization
- Goal: Finalize the application by addressing issues and adding requested features by the client.
- Key Tasks: Bug fixing, feature finalization, and project presentation preparation.
- Milestone: Completed, polished RMA application ready for deployment.
## Results (Deliverables)
- RMA Application: A web-based (and mobile) responsive application for product returns.
- Documentation: Design documents, user stories, wireframes, functional and non-functional requirements, system design and architecture.
- Testing Environment: A mock-up test environment for order management.
## Risk Management and Group Agreements

### Risk Management

- Regular progress reviews and stand-up sessions to handle potential delays or complexities with a team members task.

### Group Agreements
- Our Code of Conduct can be found in this documentation folder which outlines our homework and what happens in the case that a member is not doing his fair share or is not attending the meetings.


### Definition of Done

- User Stories: A user story is done when it has been tested according to the steps by someone who did not partake in writing the user story.
If the test is passed and all the outcomes reflect what the user sees, then the user story is complete.

- Project tasks: A project task is done when IntelliJ is able to run the code without giving an error, and another member of the team has had a look at the code to make sure it is complete, at this point
after testing they can merge the task to the main branch.

## Conclusion

To wrap up, our project for developing the RMA Application with MyShop is all about making returns easy and 
efficient. We're focusing on creating a system that customers can use online without any hassle. We're using tools like GitLab for managing our work and staying in touch through WhatsApp and Discord.
By breaking down the work into sprints, we're tackling each part of the project step by step. Our goal is to get a working, user-friendly application ready that meets what MyShop and its customers need. 
We're keeping an eye on any challenges and making sure we work together as a team. In the end, we want to deliver a great RMA system that makes returning products simple and smooth for everyone.
