## 1.0 Introduction
Throughout the coming Sprints, we have adopted the Scrum framework, an agile development method that focuses on flexibility, collaboration and client input. Scrum will allow our team to divide our backlog into more manageable sets known as sprints, allowing us to collaborate on the overall sprint goals and incorporate client feedback throughout the development process.

For the project, we have 4 Sprints, 0-3, where the initial sprint is project planning and approval by the client. After Sprint 0, we will begin implementing the plan set out previously and throughout Sprints 1-3, we will be working to achieve the goals set out and ensure the client agrees with the direction we are taking.

The scrum master and note taker will be rotating each sprint.


## 2.0 Project Backlog
The project backlog was developed during Sprint 0, we have a total of 125 items in the backlog which we hope to achieve by the end of Sprint 3.

# 3.0 SPRINT NOTES
##  3.1 Sprint 0
### 3.1.1 Sprint 0 Goals 
The following goals are what we wish to achieve during Sprint 0:
- Ensure everyone has an understanding of the project
- Assign team roles for each sprint
- Create the required documentation - PoA, CoC, Functional Design, System Design
- Create the product backlog as shown above

### 3.1.2 Sprint 0 Standups
### print 0 standUp 1 (2023-11-21)

We as a team got familiar with the project, read the assignment description, asked for teacher explanation for the unclear aspects of the projects, started planning the questions 
for the client's interview and assigned the team roles (Scrum Master - note taker) for all the sprints  

### sprint 0 standUp 2 (2023-11-23)

In this standUp, that took place after interviewing the client, we went over the notes taken by Frankie and based on them, we assigned tasks to each team member as follows: 
* Badr: got assigned to make the initial wireframes.
* Georgi: plan of approach, code of conduct, non-functional requirement.
* Frankie: problem overview and solution overview.
* Pablo: business requirements, team introduction, project introduction. 
* Desmond: requirements.
* Brice: user, functional and part of non-functional requirements.
* Marcelo : notes (Appendix B in Functional requirement)


### sprint 0 standUp 3 (2023-11-25)

During this standUp, we went over the assigned tasks to check what had been completed and what hadn't and the encountered issues.
This is what each member had completed by this standUp : 
* Badr: finished the initial wireframes. 
* Georgi: finished plan of approach, code of conduct, non-functional requirement and took over the system and user requirements as they were insufficient.
* Frankie: finished the problem overview and the solution overview from the Functional Design document.
* Pablo: finished the business requirements, team introduction and project introduction from the Functional Design document.
* Desmond: Got urgent family issue and was unable to attend and finish a task, his task was distributed throughout the team. (He flew home for a week, notified team and teacher.)
* Brice: worked on user requirements. They weren't meeting our quality criteria after team check. (Georgi refactored, check georgi's notes)
* Marcelo: He didn't finish task notes (Appendix B in Functional requirement) on time. Therefore, he got remarks from team members to keep up with the deadlines.

And those new tasks got assigned to some members who have already done with their current tasks to take over the missing elements of the FD.


### sprint 0 standUp 4 (2023-11-28)
During this standUp, we checked who had done what, and here are the results : 
* Badr: finish the additional wireframes and UI, and put description for all of them. 
* Georgi: refracted user and functional requirements. Create a use case diagram. create the design considerations part of the system design.
* Desmond: Got urgent family issue and was unable to attend and finish a task, his task was distributed throughout the team. (He flew home for a week, notified team and teacher.)
* Marcelo: finished the task (Appendix B in FD - clients notes) after deadline. Therefore, he got remarks from team members to keep up with the deadlines.

And those are the new assigned tasks : 

* Badr: Navigational diagram together with Georgi. Align wireframes with requirements and user stories. Check requirements with Georgi.
* Georgi: Navigational diagram with Badr, database design with Pablo, database schema and security diagrams.
* Frankie: Software architecture and diagrams (system design).
* Pablo: database design with Georgi. 
* Desmond: Got urgent family issue and was unable to attend and finish a task, his task was distributed throughout the team. (He flew home for a week, notified team and teacher.)
* Brice: User stories.
* Marcelo: Security architecture from System design documentation.

### sprint 0 standUp 5 (2023-11-30)
During this standUp, we checked who had done what, and here are the results :

* Badr: finished navigational diagram together with Georgi. Align wireframes with requirements and user stories. Check requirements with Georgi.
* Georgi: finished navigational diagram with Badr, database design with Pablo, database schema and security diagrams.
* Frankie: finished Software architecture and diagrams (system design).
* Pablo: finished database design with Georgi.
* Desmond: Got urgent family issue and was unable to attend and finish a task, his task was distributed throughout the team. (He flew home for a week, notified team and teacher.)
* Brice: progressed with user stories, but not finished.
* Marcelo: Again, he did not meet the deadlines. his task (Security architecture from System design documentation) was not finished. Thus, a conversation with the teacher took place.


### sprint 0 meeting instead of standUp 6 (2023-12-02)
During this meeting, we had a group discussion to address the internal issues such as communication and commitments from a particular team member. 
A warning was given to Marcelo to get more involved into the project and stick with the deadlines. 

Afterward, we did the scrum poker planning to evaluate the weight of each task, and then we stared to fill in the issues into GitLab's backlog. We did not manage to finalize all 
the issues into GitLab, so we gave each member to convert three user stories to issues(tasks) by the following day.


### sprint 0  standUp 7(2023-12-03)
During this standUp, we checked who had done what, and here are the results:
* Badr: finished Api-Specification and Gitlab issues. 
* Georgi: refactored the whole FD and SD, so that it will be ready to submit on BB and finished Gitlab issues.
* Desmond: Got urgent family issue and was unable to attend and finish a task, his task was distributed throughout the team. (He flew home for a week, notified team and teacher.)
* Brice: Finalised the user stories and Gitlab issues.
* Marcelo: finished his task (Security architecture from System design documentation) after deadline and finished Gitlab issues. 
* Pablo: finished Gitlab issues
* Frankie: finished Gitlab issues

### 3.1.3 Sprint 0 Review
In this Sprint Review, we focused on the outcomes related to our initial Sprint goals, which were the foundations for the project's success. These goals included 
ensuring a comprehensive understanding of the project among the team, assigning roles, creating essential documentation, and establishing a well-defined product backlog.

- Project Understanding: We discussed the project vision and objectives with the team, ensuring everyone started with a clear understanding of the project's purpose.
- Team Roles: Roles for this Sprint were assigned to cover all necessary functions and expertise areas effectively.
- Documentation Completion: We produced critical documents, including the Plan of Action (PoA), Code of Conduct (CoC), Functional Design, and System Design documents.
- Product Backlog: The product backlog was successfully created and prioritized, reflecting our project's requirements and setting a clear direction for development.

On completion of the documentation, we submitted it to the client for feedback which we should have by the start of Sprint 1.

### 3.3.4 Sprint 2 Review
As we conclude our latest sprint, we have made significant progress toward aligning our project 
goals with the developmental milestones we set. Here's a summary of our progress:

- Frontend and Backend Logic Connection: Our team has established the foundational connections between the frontend and backend, meaning we could start removing dummy data.
- Customer UI Implementation: The Customer User Interface (UI) has been implemented.
- Admin Analytics: We have partially implemented the Admin Analytics interface.
- User Role Restrictions: The groundwork for user role restrictions has been put in place. 
- Email API Integration: The Email API has been successfully integrated. This allows for automated email for the reset password feature.

However, we encountered some challenges that prevented the full implementation of the frontend and backend logic. The complexity of specific data fetches 
required more queries than anticipated, leading to a partial completion of this task. 
This has particularly impacted the frontend, where the necessary fetches are needed for full functionality.

Unfortunately, while we were communicating to assign tasks and working to ensure tasks were completed, we never moved tasks from testing to Done 
causing our burn-down chart to be incorrect and something we will work on during Sprint 3.
