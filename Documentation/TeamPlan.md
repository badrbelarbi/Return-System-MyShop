# Introduction

This section provides an overview of the RMA (Return Merchandise Authorization) application project, outlining its objectives and intended benefits.

# Project Overview

### Project Name
- Client On Board, Team 2

### Objective
- To design and develop a prototype RMA system for MyShop, enabling customers to return items easily and efficiently through a web-based application.   

### Scope
- In-Scope: Development of the RMA application, the testing environment and related documentation along with any external systems needed for the application to work, for example, 
a mailing system or barcode scanner in this case.

# Data Handling and Version Control

- For Data Handling and Version Control, we will use GitLab, this will allow us to create branches that each team member will work on, and after working, the team member can merge 
to the main after testing. This allows us to make sure there we can safely experiment and test our code before pushing directly into the main, ensuring that the new code remains safely contained.

# Team Structure and Communication

### Team Roles and Responsibilities
- For this project, we will have 4 Scrum Masters, one for each new sprint. Sprint 0 is Pablo, 1 is Frankie, 2 is Georgi, and 3 is Badr. 
- Each will also have a note taker, for Sprint 0 is Brice, Sprint 1 is Badr, Sprint 2 is Desmond, Sprint 3 is Frankie.
- We also have a Project Manager who will make sure we stay on track as a whole, this will be Desmond.

### Communication Channels
- Primary channels: We will use WhatsApp and Discord for regular updates on our code and for letting each other know when we merge to main.
- GitLab for progress tracking on the Backlog.

### Meeting Schedule
- We have class stand-ups every Tuesday and Thursday. We will then have at least one meeting every weekend, the day will depend on the availability of the team members.

# Plan Of Approach and Milestones

### Sprint 1: Basic Functionality and Setup
- Goal: Establish a test environment and basic User Interface for the RMA application.
- Key Tasks: Set up the databases and development environment, develop API calls, begin frontend svelte development.
- Milestone: Completed Databases with queries and a basic User Interface.

### Sprint 2: Advanced Development and Feature Integration
- Goal: Connect the databases to the frontend and complete the data fetches.
- Key Tasks: Develop additional features, enhance frontend and backend connectivity.
- Milestone: Advanced version of the RMA application with integrated features.

### Sprint 3: Refinement and Finalization
- Goal: Finalize the application by addressing issues and adding requested features by the client.
- Key Tasks: Bug fixing, feature finalization, and project presentation preparation.
- Milestone: Completed, polished RMA application ready for deployment.

## Results (Deliverables)
- RMA Application: A web-based (and mobile) responsive application for product returns.
- Documentation: Design documents, user stories, wireframes, functional and non-functional requirements, system design and architecture.
- Testing Environment: A mock-up test environment for order management.
## Risk Management and Group Agreements

### Risk Management

- Regular progress reviews and stand-up sessions to handle potential delays or complexities with a team members task.

# Group Agreements
 

## Organization and Meeting Structures

### Class Stand-Ups:
- **Frequency**: Every Tuesday and Thursday.
- **Purpose**: Share updates, discuss challenges, and strategize solutions.
- **Requirement**: Briefly communicate and show progress and challenges before each meeting.

### Homework Tasks:
- **Individual Responsibility**: Ensure consistent progress on assigned tasks.
- **Tracking**: Update the team’s time management sheet after each task milestone, notify the team members upon completion via WhatsApp or Discord, update the status accordingly on the GitLab's user stories.

### Weekend Collaboration Sessions (virtual 3rd stand-up):
- **Platform**: Discord.
- **Agenda**: Review past week's issues and plan for the upcoming week.
- **Preparation**: Bring ideas for improvement and potential solutions to problems faced.

## Code of Conduct:

### Meeting Attendance and Communication:
- If unable to attend a meeting, notify the team 24 hours in advance.
- Provide a written update on your task status before the missed meeting.

### Absence Notification:
- In case of class absence, email Eelco Jannink and also provide a brief to the scrum master.

### Unexpected Delays in Task Completion:
- Inform the team as soon as possible.
- Propose a revised timeline and strategy to catch up. Ask for assistance and if unable to complete the task, try to break it down into smaller feasible parts.

### Detailed Task Documentation:
- Document each task with objectives, progress, and any blockers (notes taken by the respective note taker for the sprint).
- Use the team's shared Word documentation for consistency.

### Adaptability in Task Management:
- If a task is too complex, propose a breakdown into smaller, manageable parts.
- If stuck, actively seek assistance from team members.
- Be open to reassigning tasks based on team feedback and changing priorities.

### Cooperation and Team Support:
- Actively participate in team discussions.
- Offer help to team members in need.
- Share resources and knowledge for the collective benefit of the team.

### Team Values:
- Considering that this is the first project where we have a client on board, we are going to learn a lot a long the way we want to keep that in mind, as we are not going to do everything perfect from the beginning, but will try to get better every day individually as well as a team.
- It is important to maintain a good harmony in the group and a safe space for everyone to feel comfortable and work in the most optimal conditions.
- As this is a team project its everyones job to keep up to date with the tasks that are assigned in order to keep the truth we put on each other in this assignment.
- In addition to the trust we must have , we lso need to be transparent with each other and support each other to become better, by being transparent we can help each other out and know each others strengths and weakness in order to rely on each other

### Conflict Resolution:
- Avoid confrontation.
- Focus on problem-solving rather than personal blame.
- Strive for solutions that benefit the team.

### Effective Time Management:
- Register your work time in the mutual Excel time management spreadsheet.


### Discipline
- In the case that someone does not respect the rules and the values that we are stading on, actions will be taken against them:
-  - In case it's the first time, we will give a warning.
-  - Second time, a strike will be given to the person
-  - Third time, a second strike will be given to the person
-  - And lastly the person will be removed from the team.
- We do not want this to happen but this will be the measures we will take in case.


## Definition of Done

- User Stories: A user story is done when it has been tested according to the steps by someone who did not partake in writing the user story.
If the test is passed and all the outcomes reflect what the user sees, then the user story is complete.

- Project tasks: A project task is done when IntelliJ is able to run the code without giving an error, and another member of the team has had a look at the code to make sure it is complete, at this point
after testing they can merge the task to the main branch.

## Conclusion

To wrap up, our project for developing the RMA Application with MyShop is all about making returns easy and 
efficient. We're focusing on creating a system that customers can use online without any hassle. We're using tools like GitLab for managing our work and staying in touch through WhatsApp and Discord.
By breaking down the work into sprints, we're tackling each part of the project step by step. Our goal is to get a working, user-friendly application ready that meets what MyShop and its customers need. 
We're keeping an eye on any challenges and making sure we work together as a team. In the end, we want to deliver a great RMA system that makes returning products simple and smooth for everyone.
